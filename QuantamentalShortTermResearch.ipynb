      "<p>Moreover, Alphabet faces other fundamental challenges, including losing advertising market share to Meta and Amazon and perceptions of being less committed to operational efficiency compared to its competitors. However, MoffettNathanson highlighted that Google's ad business has been gradually losing market share to these companies over the past decade, with the exception of strong performance in 2021 and 2022. Therefore, the firm views the recent market share loss in 2023 as relatively unexceptional.</p>\n",

Service revenues are anticipated to grow in double digits, with potential upside from recent price hikes, while other hardware products might see a high single-digit decline. China's revenues declined by 12% year-over-year, with iPhone sales slightly better but still down in mid-single digits in constant currency.

Firstly, L3Harris is anticipated to significantly enhance its margins over the next three years, potentially surpassing its targets, while its counterparts are expected to see relatively stable margins. </p>\n",
      "<p>Secondly, L3Harris is moving past factors that have previously hindered its equity story, unlike some major competitors who continue to face escalating challenges, such as Lockheed Martin with its F-35 delivery issues and Terran Orbital supplier risks, and Northrop Grumman with its B-21 and Sentinel projects. The third differentiator is L3Harris's long-standing yet increasingly unjustifiable lower valuation compared to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, despite L3Harris's clearer margin improvement prospects and decreasing relative risk. </p>\n",
      "<p>In summary, Deutsche Bank sees L3Harris as presenting both an opportunity for positive financial revisions, driven by revenue and margin increases and a chance for relative valuation improvement, due to its diverging margin trajectory and risk profile in comparison to other large-cap defense companies.</p>\n",
